# Todo
A full-stack Todo application built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend.
This app allows you to:
Add, edit, and delete todos
Mark todos as complete/incomplete
View your todo list with a modern, responsive UI
Persist your data with a MongoDB database
Frontend:
Built with React and Vite for fast development and hot reloading
Styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a clean, modern look
Uses Axios for API requests
Backend:
Node.js and Express REST API
MongoDB for data storage
Full CRUD support for todos
How it works:
The frontend communicates with the backend API to manage todos. All changes are saved in a MongoDB database, so your todos persist across sessions.
